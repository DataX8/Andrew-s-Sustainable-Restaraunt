<h2>About the Project</h2>
<div class="container">
<img src="/assets/projectPhoto.png" id="projectPic">
<p>The goal of the project is to craft an aesthectically appealing and also sustainable building to add to the grand result:"Forthtopia". I was tasked to creating a restaraunt, and equipped it with solar panels, power generating wind tubines, native plants, power walls, locally sourced food and more! I hope you enjoy this project!</p>

    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <img src="/assets/motor.png" id="portrait">
    <p>On the top of my 2 feet tall sign, I attached the power generating wind turbine, which is made up of a recycled battery and motor pack, pieces of an old pasta box, zip ties, and tape. This was designed to spin clockwise. I did this by reversing the polarity of the wires, causing the motor to spin backwards, and making the turbine look both aesthectically appealing and a wonderous desingn.</p>
